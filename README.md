# FlexER: Flexible Entity Resolution

FlexER is a mehthod for solving multiple intents entity resolution (MIER) problem.
FlexER combines independent intent solutions to improve outcome to multiple resolution problems, by using graph convolutional network (GCN).
The independent intent solutions are based on solutions to universal ER tasks, such that every matcher which can provide a latent representation of record pairs can be adjusted to our framework.
In this work, we use [DITTO](https://github.com/megagonlabs/ditto), the state-of-the-art in universal ER. Specifically, we use the final embedding of the special token [cls](used for classification) as a record pair representation, and inject it into the FlexER system.
